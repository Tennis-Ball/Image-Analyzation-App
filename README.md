# Camera Utility App ðŸ”Ž

Ahoy!

Thanks for checking out this project, it is a functional app built on the react-native mobile framework for deployment in any operating system.
The app can identify species of living organisms, everyday objects, scan QR codes, save photos, and identify colors in a photo by pixel.

This app utilizes Google TensorFlow's "Mobile Net" model, initially trained on 1000 classes with a convolutional neural network (CNN). This processes took weeks,
to make prediction speed take seconds. The project incorporates RN navigation and RN camera.

To use, first pull this repo to your local. Install the expo cli by running "npm start" and allow global installation. Once the cli is installed, 
you will be prompted through the new terminal interface to open an Android simulator or web version. Happy coding!
